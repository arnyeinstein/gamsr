gamsr is a small package that helps importing all or selected data from a gdx file generated by GAMS using a single command.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gamsr)
import_gdxfile("trnsport.gdx") # Reads all data from a gdx file
import_gdxfile("trnsport.gdx", c("Z","d")) # Reads selected data from a file.
```
